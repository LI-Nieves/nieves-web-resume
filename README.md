# Lee Nieves' personal portfolio website

Welcome to my website! Feel free to scroll through and learn about myself and my experiences.

I built this website for a few reasons:
- Practice web development, particularly using the React library
- Be able to showcase my experiences in projects in my own way, rather than being constricted to a concise resume or LinkedIn's UI
- Work on a solo project

I am the sole contributor to my website. 

Currently, it's a static website that only shows my resume information. I would like to expand it when I get the chance.

## TODO, for now
- Refactoring to compartmentalize my work, education, and projects section
- Navbar frozen at the top for each section
- Add additional info + photos
- Change favicon

## TODO, for later
- Complete the website so that it's generally presentable with accurate information.
- Make sure that it's responsive and has good accessibility.
- Set it up on GitHub pages instead (maybe).
- Clean the code and make sure it's documented and without redundancy.
- Make it a dynamic website with a database, rather than having my information in hard-coded JSON objects.
- Add other parts to my website (showcase assignments, LaTeX creations, etc.)
